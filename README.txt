This project was creating a program that can read from a txt file and converting the temperature read in fahrenheit into celsius and into a new txt file with the city name and temperature in celsius.
One thing I did particularly well was add comments giving brief explanations throughout the code.
Embarrassing but I couldn't figure out how to get the txt file read for a while. I watched a few YouTube videos and realized I had to put the actual txt file into the root project folder.
The skill I acquired from this project was learning how to get files read and output to a new file.
I made this code maintanable, readable and adaptable by following standards and adding comments.
